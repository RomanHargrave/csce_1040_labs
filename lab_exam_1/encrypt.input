9 the rain in spain falls mainly on the plains
6 the man engineers the profuse danger
6 the heat accelerates the brawny change
6 the trick maps the superficial stretch
5 the structure converts the value
6 the gaudy exchange enables the snow
5 the meal assesses the note
6 the kick confers the economic person
6 the bright group studies the lift
6 the dear music advertises the woman
5 the week maps the birth
