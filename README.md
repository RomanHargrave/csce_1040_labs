# CSCE 1040 Spring 2015 Labs

This repository contains all completed lab assignments for the
aforementioned semester.

Although it is unlikely that these assignments will be used for another
semester, especially considering that this was the last semester for this
course to use C, reuse of these solutions is considered plagiarism, and
will be *blatantly* obvious because none of my solutions remotely resemble
the prebuilt solution from Keathly's public folder. Should you use this
for academia, I will not be held reponsible for whatever flaming heap of
trouble you get yourself in.

That being said, I do not care if you use this for anything other than
academia (do you bloody homework, otherwise, figure out why you're taking
a CS course), and for all intents and purposes this code is public domain.
